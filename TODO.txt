Migration:
1.	Add User with Identity, roles, claims, etc.
2.	In Transaction and Budget add UserId field. (Id only as they should not know of the User object!)
3.	Add Name to Budget.

General:
1.	Add API versioning to all endpoints and frontend.
2.	Validate everywhere that when editing in any form the user is either Admin or the owner of the object.
3.	Change return types of the API to have a common response object that includes success/failure, messages, and data.
4.	When updating data, log only the changed fields with old and new values.
5.	Add Resources for all strings for localization.
6.	Change pagination from index/page to cursor based pagination.
7.	Event Ids for exceptions?
8.	Dont use actual GUIDs in the API, use shortend ids instead.
